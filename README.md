Pipeline: 
Sequencing (to obtian short fragmented DNA sequences which are stored in .fastq files) --> Cortex Var Process (to compare sample genomes with reference genome so that the variances will be summarized in a .vcf file) --> Upload Data to Database (parse the .vcf file into tables based on the framework of database) --> Biostatistical Analysis and Data Representation
